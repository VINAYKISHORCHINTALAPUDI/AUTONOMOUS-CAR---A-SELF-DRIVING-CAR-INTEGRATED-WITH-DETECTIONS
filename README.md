# AUTONOMOUS-CAR-(A-SELF-DRIVING-CAR-INTEGRATED-WITH-DETECTIONS)
Now a days accidents are increasing due to negligence of people (Over speeding, Drunken driving, Distractions to driver, Red light jumping, Non-adherence to lane driving and overtaking in a wrong manner ). In order to reduce these causes for accidents, We designed a project named Autonomous car.
It is already known that, a lot of research work is going on across the globe on design of autonomous vehicles/self-driving cars/driverless cars and few of them may become a reality soon on the roads. And popular prestigious companies like Tesla, Kia-Hyundai, Ford, Audi are on the race for manfacturing Autonomous cars. But, this technology will be appreciated when it will work with maximum efficiency and simultaneously when it is made available to the general public even. 
In our proposal, we would like to design a prototype of self-driving car which uses machine learning algorithms and will fulfill the following objectives: 
1.   Collision Avoidance System 
2.   GPS based routing of vehicle 
3.   Lane Detection 
4.   Object/ Obstacle Detection 

We are using DE-10 Nano FPGA board for lane detection as we used FPGA vision Sobel filter/edge detection algorithm on concept basis of Hough transform and SVM. We used FPGA  for obstacle detection using Haar cascade algorithm. And we used FPGA  for Global positioning system (GPS). FPGA analyses and process the input data that is recieved from sensors and camera and pass the control signals to Arduino. And Arduino controls the car with the help of Motor driver.

This plan spins around the idea of self-driving vehicles with the most recent innovation of FPGA. The focal thought behind this plan is to decrease the passing pace of people while going on streets. We might stay away from the wild fender benders, thoughtless driving, crummy choice taken by drivers, infringement of traffic rules and over speeding, and so forth Then again, in the forthcoming years, it is going to assume a pivotal part in the car business. This plan has the ability and usefulness with a wide scope of utilizations for any vehicle. Plan of our task can be utilized in various regions primarily on-street vehicles (i.e., car, truck, bus, and any other transportation vehicles).

I designed an efficient and reliable real-time prototype of autonomous car with features of lane detection, object detection, distance measurement, GPS tracking and collision avoidance system. This system accurately takes quick decisions in accordance with the surroundings. I have also implemented detections monitoring system and car control monitoring system using Microsoft azure cloud.
